# üë• Detecting & Preventing Shadow MCP Server Usage

## Author Information

Created by the team at: [MCP Manager](https://mcpmanager.ai/). MCP Manager is an MCP gateway which ensures secure enterprise adoption of AI agents and MCP servers.

Our team will be adding lots of valuable checklists and other resources for people creating and securing their MCP ecosystem.

## üëã Intro/Disclaimer

Below is a mix of steps to follow and options to prevent and uncover shadow MCP server use in your organization.

If you don't know what shadow servers are, it's essentially the same as shadow IT - people in an organization using MCP servers that haven't been approved by, and aren't visible to the organization's responsible people - the IT, infosecurity, or cybersecurity teams.

Note that some of these recommendations are dependent on having specific technologies in place, or consist of a choice of multiple options to achieve the same capability.

Of course, all of the below are just helpful, practical suggestions. It is ultimately your responsibility to decide how you will secure your organization against shadow MCP server use and other MCP-based security risks. For comprehensive mitigation against MCP-based security risks use an MCP gateway like our own MCP Manager.

## üëÆ Process and Policy/Directives

-   **Create and document a clear process (workflow)** for requesting, reviewing, and approving new MCP servers. This process should include what steps and/or utilities reviewing personnel should follow to detect security threats or other issues in MCP servers and their tools, such as checking tool metadata for malicious instructions.
-  **Maintain an MCP server inventory** that includes details like the server's approval status, who has access rights to it, when it was added, who requested and approved it, and other key information that would be useful when auditing and evaluating your MCP server stack. If you are using an [MCP gateway](https://mcpmanager.ai/blog/mcp-gateway/) or proxy then your inventory will be created and updated automatically when you add servers to it.
    -   Create a robust MCP server usage policy for your organization, which makes it clear that:
    -   All MCP servers must be submitted to, reviewed, and approved by the information security team (or equivalent) before use.
    -   No one should use unauthorized MCP servers
    -   How to submit a new MCP server for review
    -   What to do if you become aware of an unauthorized MCP server
    -   What to do if you become aware of people using authorized MCP servers that they shouldn't have access to (or performing actions they don't have permissions for).

-  **Distribute easily accessible guidance** which explains your MCP Server Use Policy and process for requesting a new server or access to an existing server (if you have access policies in place).
-  **Require explicit agreement** by creating a process (such as using a survey or forms software) to ensure that everyone in your organization reviews your guidance and policy, understands the reasons why following your policy and processes is essential, and formally agrees to abide by your policy and processes.

## üëÅÔ∏è Shadow Server Detection

In addition to ensuring every team member knows how to add new MCP servers and how and why to report the use of unauthorized servers, there are automated methods you can use to scan your environment and identify unauthorized servers.

Below are some options you can use.

### üö¶ Network Traffic and Usage Monitoring

If your organization uses a Next-Generation Firewall, IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), or other platform with deep packet inspection capabilities, you can configure it to identify MCP server use signatures and patterns, such as:

-   JSON messages including "jsonrpc": "2.0" and method calls including "initialize"
-   Calls to typical MCP endpoints (e.g., /mcp, /api/mcp, /messages)
-   Response headers that include values like "MCP-Session-ID"¬†
-   Responses using Content-Type"text/event-stream" (used in SSE MCP transports)

If your organization uses an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solution, or an IDS you can use it to:

-   Monitor for common MCP processes
-   Use custom detection rules/YARA signature to flag typical MCP server launch procedures (e.g., python mcp-server.py, or node mcp-sever.js)
-   Also use a file system watcher to flag when MCP config files or registration scripts are added (e.g. mcp_server.py)

### üîé Scripted Scanners

You can also run a script to scan for MCP servers in your organization, by mimicking the MCP handshake across common ports and endpoints used by MCP servers.

This can be a riskier method, with its own potential security risks, and should not be attempted by anyone without the necessary authorization and expertise to do so.

-   Use a language supported by MCP SDKs (e.g., Java, Python, Typescript)
-   Install libraries for HTTP requests and JSON-RPC communications.
-   Identify the common ports where MCPs may be running (e.g., 3000,443, 8000)
-   Create a script that sends MCP JSON-RPC "initialize" handshake requests to network hosts on those common ports. For example:
```
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "capabilities": {}
  }
}
```
-   Within the script use HTTP POST transport to those endpoints commonly used by MCP servers like /mcp or /api/mcp. You should have something like:
```
endpoints =
[
¬†¬†"http://192.168.1.10:3000/mcp",

¬†¬†"http://192.168.1.15:8000/api/mcp"

]
```
- Within the script specify what a successful response is (i.e. a valid MCP server response which includes that server's capabilities)
- Add a value for a successful response (e.g. _"MCP Server Discovered at {endpoint} with capabilities: {capabilities}"_) and a value for no response/the response doesn't match the MCP JSON-RPC format¬† (e.g. _"No MCP Server at {endpoint}"_)
- Consider whether you want to exclude known/allowed servers from your scan. This should make it faster to sift through the results, but it could leave a gap for detecting "spoof" or "imitation" servers so it may be better to filter the results of the scan, rather than filter the scan itself.
- Ensure that your scan respects existing security policies, and does not risk data leakage or unauthorized access.
- Plan out your scans- including timing, frequency, and followup actions - with your security and network teams

### ü§ñ AI Agents

In the near-future you will be able to use an AI agent to scan for MCP usage signals in your organization. These agents use most of the same detection methods as you would build into a script (see above).

However, unlike using a script, an agent based system can provide real-time detection of new MCP servers, and automation of mutli-step workflows and enforcement mechanisms.

We're not able to provide comprehensive guidance on how to build your own shadow MCP "guard dog" style agent right now. We plan to add some more detailed instructions soon, but for now check out our [AI agent building checklist](https://github.com/MCP-Manager/MCP-Checklists/blob/main/ai-agent-building.md).

## Securing MCP Server Use for Enterprise

Shadow MCP use is just one of the many security risks that enterprises using AI and MCP servers need to protect themselves against. Here is a [list of the key MCP-based security risks](https://github.com/MCP-Manager/MCP-Checklists/blob/main/infrastructure/docs/mcp-security-threat-list.md) you should be aware of right now.
