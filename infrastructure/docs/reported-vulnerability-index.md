# Index of Reported MCP-Based Security Vulnerabilities

## Intro

Here the MCP Manager team will build up an index of reported vulnerabilities, both in specific MCP servers and MCP servers generally.

This is not intended as a live feed of which servers have live security risks (there are already platforms and databases for that purpose), instead this index will serve as a resource of MCP-based vulnerabilities - and patterns of vulnerability - that have been provably exploited, to help MCP builders and users to secure their own servers.

For more information on types of vulnerabilities and attack vectors types - and the most effective mitigations for them - use our "[MCP Security Threat-List](https://github.com/MCP-Manager/MCP-Checklists/blob/main/infrastructure/docs/mcp-security-threat-list.md)" (in this same repo)

# üî¨ Detailed Records

## üî© Misconfiguration Exploitations

### :closed_lock_with_key: Asana MCP Cross-Tenant Unauthorized Access

**Date Reported:** June 4, 2025

**Affected Servers:** Asana MCP servers supporting approximately 1,000 customers

**Category:** Multi-Tenant Data Leakage / Privacy Breach

**Description:** A logic bug in Asana's MCP server caused data from one customer's Asana instance to be exposed to other customers' MCP instances. This cross-tenant data leakage could include task-level information, project metadata, team details, comments, discussions, and possibly uploaded files‚Äîlimited to the access scope of each user. The flaw resulted in a breach of tenant data isolation, allowing data bleed across organizational boundaries in the MCP environment.

**Impact/Result:** Potential exposure of sensitive customer data across organizational boundaries, impacting around 1,000 customers. Although there is no public indication of malicious exploitation or confirmed data viewing by unauthorized parties, the risk of privacy violations and regulatory implications was significant. Asana took the MCP integration offline for nearly two weeks to contain and patch the issue.

**Mitigations For This/Similar Attacks:**

- Immediate shutdown of affected MCP service upon discovery to prevent further exposure.
- Patch the MCP server to fix the logic flaw causing cross-tenant data leakage.
- Enforce strict tenant isolation controls in MCP integration.
- Implement robust testing and validation of multi-tenant data segregation in MCP deployments.
- Pause automated MCP reconnections until trust and security are verified.

### :closed_lock_with_key: MCP Servers ‚ÄúNeighborJack‚Äù 0.0.0.0 Exploit 

**Date Reported:** Jun 25, 2025

**Affected Servers:** Hundreds of servers identified with this vulnerability.

**Category:** Network Exposure/Misconfiguration 

**Description:** Hundreds of MCP servers were explicitly bound to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0), making them accessible to anyone on the same local network.

**Impact/Result:** No recorded successful real exploitations of this vulnerability to date. However, the potential impact includes unauthorized access to the MCP server, which, combined with other vulnerabilities (such as excessive permissions or unchecked input), could allow attackers to execute commands, take control of the host machine, impersonate AI tools, or conduct context poisoning attacks.

**Mitigations:**
- (With Gateway): Restrict MCP server binding to trusted network interfaces only, ideally not 0.0.0.0. Use network segmentation and firewall rules to limit access to MCP servers to authorized users/devices within the network. Enable authentication and access controls at the server and gateway level.
- (Without Gateway): Avoid binding MCP servers to all interfaces (0.0.0.0). Apply strict local firewall rules to block unwanted local network traffic. Disable unnecessary services and ports. Implement robust input validation and least privilege permissions on the server to reduce risk even if accessed.

### :closed_lock_with_key: Anthropic Filesystem MCP Server Directory Containment Bypass (CVE-2025-53110)

**Date Reported:** July 2nd, 2025

**Affected Servers:** Anthropic Filesystem MCP Server versions before 0.6.3 / 2025.7.1

**Category:** Directory Containment Bypass / Sandbox Escape

**Description:** The MCP server uses a naive prefix check to validate if file access requests reside within an allowed directory. Attackers exploit this by specifying file paths that start with allowed directory names but actually point outside the sandbox.

**Impact/Result:** Researchers gained unauthorized file system access to sensitive files outside the sandbox. This could lead to exfiltration of credentials, config, and critical system files.

**Mitigations:**

- Update Anthropic Filesystem MCP server to version 0.6.3 or later
- Impose strict file path canonicalization and validation techniques
- Run MCP servers with limited file system permissions aligned to the least privilege principle
- Use an MCP gateway to validate and filter file access requests before they reach the MCP server

### :closed_lock_with_key: MCP Inspector (<0.14.1) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596)

**Date Reported: June 2025**

**Affected Servers:** Anthropic MCP Inspector versions prior to 0.14.1

**Category:** Remote Code Execution / Authentication Bypass

**Description:**

MCP Inspector is a developer-oriented debugging tool for MCP servers, consisting of a React-based client and a Node.js proxy bridging to MCP servers. Versions prior to 0.14.1 lack authentication between the client UI and the proxy server, allowing unauthenticated HTTP requests to launch arbitrary MCP commands over stdio.

Exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with network access can send crafted requests to the proxy‚Äôs endpoints, executing arbitrary OS commands with the permissions of the MCP Inspector process. This attack can be triggered remotely through browser behaviors like the ‚Äú0.0.0.0 Day‚Äù vulnerability or DNS rebinding, allowing malicious websites to bypass same-origin policies and reach exposed local MCP Inspector instances.

**Impact/Result:** Successful exploitation leads to full remote code execution on the developer‚Äôs machine, enabling persistent access, credential theft, lateral movement across networks, and potential deployment of malware. This represents a critical risk for AI development environments relying on MCP Inspector.

**Mitigations:**

- Upgrade MCP Inspector to version 0.14.1 or newer, which enforces authentication and origin validation.
- Bind MCP Inspector proxy services to localhost and restrict trusted origins.
- Avoid exposing MCP Inspector proxy publicly or to untrusted networks.
- Use network segmentation and firewall rules to limit access to MCP Inspector instances.
- Monitor for suspicious local requests to MCP Inspector proxy endpoints.

### :closed_lock_with_key: Anthropic Filesystem MCP Server Symlink Bypass (CVE-2025-53109)

Date Reported: July 2nd, 2025

Affected Servers: Anthropic Filesystem MCP Server (versions before 0.6.3/2025.7.1)

Category: Symlink Bypass / Sandbox Escape

**Description:**

Due to improper symlink resolution, attackers can create symbolic links inside allowed directories that point to critical system files or directories outside the sandbox. This enables unauthorized read/write access to protected files anywhere on the host. Attackers can drop malicious payloads or scripts via these symlinks, triggering arbitrary OS code execution and full system compromise.

**Impact/Result:** Full host compromise is possible through escalation from arbitrary file access to arbitrary code execution. Sensitive system and application files may be exposed or modified, posing severe security risks when MCP servers run with elevated privileges.

**Mitigations:**

- Update to version 0.6.3 or later
- Restrict MCP server process privileges and filesystem access rights.
- Monitor file and process activity to detect suspicious symlink creation or code execution attempts.
- Deploy an MCP gateway to enforce sandboxing rules and detect anomalous file operations.

## üíâ Prompt/Command Injections:

### :closed_lock_with_key: Atlassian MCP Prompt Injection Via Support Ticket

**Date Reported:** June 2025

**Affected Servers**: Atlassian MCP instances with Jira Service Management (JSM) and Confluence integrations

**Category:** Privileged Prompt Injection

**Description:**

Researchers at Cato Networks inserted a malicious prompt into a Jira Service Management support ticket, which manipulated MCP‚Äëconnected AI agents into running commands using the internal support engineer‚Äôs privileges. The researchers exfiltrated sensitive tenant data without accessing the system directly direct system or MCP access, exploiting untrusted external input in privileged AI contexts.

**Impact/Result:**

Potential leakage of internal ticket data and confidential tenant information via the support thread. Demonstrated as a working Proof‚Äëof‚ÄëConcept but poses high‚Äëimpact data breach risk.

**Mitigations:**

- Use an MCP Gateway to sanitize prompts and enforce access controls and permissions onto AI agents as well as human users
- Strong input validation and prompt isolation
- Monitor/audit MCP command execution

### :closed_lock_with_key: GitHub MCP Prompt Injection

**Date Reported:** May 26, 2025

**Affected Servers:** GitHub MCP servers managing multiple repositories, including private ones accessible by developers using MCP-enabled AI assistants

**Category:** Prompt Injection

**Description:** Researchers placed hidden prompt injection payloads into issues in public GitHub repositories. These prompts successfully influenced AI agents (which had broad OAuth permissions across organizational repositories) into creating public pull requests that contained sensitive data, and proprietary code.

**Impact/Result:** Attackers could exfiltrate private repository content, including source code and sensitive project details, by manipulating AI agents into publishing confidential data in public pull requests.

**Mitigations:**

- Use an MCP gateway to enforce permissions and runtime guardrails for AI agents
- Use an MCP gateway to block/sanitize retrieved data for malicious prompts
- Avoid using broad OAuth tokens and limit AI agent permissions to least privilege
- Enforce human review/explicit approval for AI-generated pull requests
- Restrict AI agent repository scope to avoid cross-repository data access.

### :closed_lock_with_key: Supabase Cursor Agent SQL Injection
**Date Reported:** June 6th 2025<br>
**Affected Servers:** Supabase MCP servers running the Cursor agent with service_role access (bypassing Row-Level Security)

**Category:** Privileged Prompt Injection / Command Injection with Data Exfiltration

**Description:** <br>Supabase‚Äôs Cursor agent (when operating with elevated service_role privileges) executed SQL commands embedded in support tickets. Malicious instructions in the support ticket text caused the agent to access and read sensitive tables (including access tokens) and then post the sensitive data back into the ticket thread (successful exfiltration).

**Impact/Result:** <br>A single prompt injection was able to fully expose an SQL database, which could enable sensitive data exfiltration, and multi-system takeover if the stolen credentials were used before they could be deactivated.

**Mitigations:**
- Use an MCP gateway to filter, sanitize or block malicious or harmful inputs and outputs between agent/user and MCP server
- Use an MCP gateway to enforce strict role-based access
- Wrap all SQL responses with prompting that dissuades LLMs from following instructions or commands within user submitted data
- Use ‚Äúdata masking‚Äù to obscure sensitive data
- Do not run agents with full service_role access (principle of least privilege)
- Don‚Äôt give agents write access (this would‚Äôve prevented sensitive data being added into the ticket thread)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Poisoning:

### :closed_lock_with_key: MCP Remote - Remote Code Execution Via Crafted Authorization Endpoint (CVE-2025-6514)

**Date Reported: July 2025**

**Affected Servers:** MCP-Remote versions 0.0.5 through 0.1.15

**Category:** Command Injection/Remote Code Execution **(via Tool Poisoning)**

**Description:**

A critical vulnerability in the mcp-remote client proxy allows attackers controlling a malicious MCP server to execute arbitrary OS commands on the client machine. During connection initialization and OAuth authorization, the malicious MCP server returns a specially crafted authorization_endpoint URL. When mcp-remote processes this URL, it triggers a command injection due to unsafe handling of URL input, launching commands on the client‚Äôs underlying OS.

This exposure affects popular MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop) that use mcp-remote to communicate with remote MCP servers over HTTP/S. The vulnerability enables full system compromise if exploited successfully.

**Impact/Result:**

Attackers can gain full remote code execution on the victim‚Äôs machine running mcp-remote, potentially leading to complete system control. On Windows, the exploit allows full command execution with parameter control; on macOS/Linux, arbitrary executable execution with some limitations is possible.

**Mitigations:**

- Upgrade mcp-remote to version 0.1.16 or later where the vulnerability is fixed.
- Connect only to trusted MCP servers using secure transport (HTTPS).
- Avoid connecting to untrusted or unknown MCP servers.
- Monitor MCP client activity and logs for unusual authorization URL accesses or command executions.
- Employ an MCP gateway to validate MCP server responses and intercept suspicious authorization URLs before they reach the client.
